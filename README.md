# Task-5-Wireshark-analysis
cybersecurity internship task(5)- Wireshark analysis

## Objective:
To analyze live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

## Tools Used:
- Wireshark

## Steps Performed:
1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Captured live network traffic for ~2 minutes.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging servers.
4. Applied filters for HTTP, DNS, and TCP.
5. Identified the following protocols:
   - *HTTP* (Port 80) – Unencrypted web traffic
   - *DNS* (Port 53) – Domain name resolution
   - *TCP* – Reliable transport protocol

## Output Files:
- network_capture.pcap – Raw packet capture
- Screenshots showing filtered packets
- This README report

## Learned:
- Understood how protocols work at network layer.
- Learned to use Wireshark filters.
- Gained hands-on packet analysis skills.
